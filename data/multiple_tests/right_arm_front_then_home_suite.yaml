# Yaml parameters: Description
# (required default_wait_time_after_publishing: If wait_time_after_publishing is not available, this number is used instead.
# (required) list_of_tests: list of yaml files with parameters to run in sequence.
#    - (required) filepath: Location of the yaml file with a prefix of the ros package path.
#      (required) message_type: the type of message from the controller_msgs package
#      (optional) wait_time_after_publishing: A required time to wait in seconds after publishing the message. This could be an estimate
#                                  of the total trajectory time. This number may be very small if a bunch of messages want to be sent simultaenously.
#      (optional) update_pose: Boolean (defaults to True) to specify if the pose of the robot should be updated when this message is published.
#                   If not specified, the default value of this parameter is True. 
#                   If the value is True, the test suite state machine will wait for a pose callback to occur before publishing the message.
#                   If the value is False, the test suite state machine will immediately publish the next message without a pose update.
#      (optional) process_next_message_immediately: Boolean (defaults to False) to specify whether the next message should be processed immediately after the wait
#                      This should be set to false if the message is at the end of the queue.
#                      If set to True, the next yaml file will immediately be processed 
#                      If set to False, the next yaml file will be processed after the specified wait time and after the robot has stopped moving.
#                      If not specified, the default value of this parameter is False. As we want the robot to be stopped before sending the next message
#      (optional) pause_at_step: Integer. An integer which sets at what point should the step be paused
#      (optional) pause_at_time: Positive real number. Time during a trajectory (not a footstep) should a StopAllTrajectories message be sent
